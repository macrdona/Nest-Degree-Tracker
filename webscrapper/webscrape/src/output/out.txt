3 credits


3 credits
Description: Focusing on the United States, this course explores the relationship between humans and Nature over time.

Scholars in this field are concerned with such things as deforestation, pollution, climate change, cities, farming, and “green” politics among other things. This is a course on human history, not natural history. As a relatively new field, environmental history allows us to pose important and/or well-worn historical questions in new ways, or to ask new questions about old historical topics. This will be a lecture based class, although we will draw upon discussions, films, and field trips. Students' learning will be assessed through quizzes, essays, a midterm, and a final.

ASH 3402: Traditional China
3 credits


3 credits
                                Traditional China evokes a vision of a virtuous emperor in the center, who, with the help of a cumbersome bureaucracy, broadcasts to the empire timeless Confucian ethical principles such as loyalty and filial piety, so as better to govern a stable and compliant agrarian society. Fortunately, this apparently rigid mold proves, more often than not, to be plastic. Broken up by periods of chaos and upheaval, traditional China features a flamboyant pageant of characters- megalomaniacal emperors, devious palace women, sycophantic poets, wandering scholars, calculating merchants, scheming ministers, daoist mystics, and rebel peasants claiming appointments from heaven-who collectively flaunted, challenged, and reshaped its structure.

The pillars that had for more than two millennia upheld the edifice of traditional China-the imperial monarchy and the Confucian bureaucracy-were no more. This course follows the painstaking transition from tradition to modernity in China, as the Chinese culture transformed gradually into a Chinese nation. Themes include: imperialism, westernization, nationalism, tensions between traditional and modern ideas, student activism and political change, and democracy and communism.

ASN 3106: (FC) Women and Gender in East Asia
3 credits


3 credits
Description: There is a common perception that Asian cultures traditionally were and still are wholly patriarchal, societies where “men are venerated and women are denigrated” (as a Chinese saying goes). It turns out that such a simple paradigm is inadequate to capture the complexity of gender dynamics in either traditional or modern Asia. In traditional times, women sometimes broke free of the domestic, inner sphere and became warriors, nuns, or poets—several even ascended to the pinnacle of political power and became rulers. We explore several themes: normative gender roles, challenges to and defiance of these normative roles, the homosexual tradition, and changes in gender roles and expectations in modern and contemporary Asia.

Threshold Project courses will explore a significant and complex question raised within the student's Venture Studies course work or within the student's General Education experience. The project will demonstrate that the student understands the multidimensional nature of any significant question, and will point toward future study necessary to more fully understand the complexity of the question. The project is not intended to answer the question, but to explore the dimensions and implications of the question from the perspective of at least two disciplines. Students positioned at this threshold between Venture Studies and more specialized work within a major will make explicit their recognition that any seemingly complete answer to a question is always situated within the terms and limits of a discipline or a particular world view, and they are bidden to be both expert within their chosen field's terms and aware of their limits.

Description: There are no prerequisites for this course. There has been a substantial upsurge of privately organized, voluntary actions around the globe in recent times. This upsurge was due to an overall dissatisfaction with the operations of both the market and the state. A broad range of institutions that occupy the social space between the market and the state tackle most of our social, political and economic concerns these days. Known as “civil society”, “nonprofit sector” or the “third sector”, institutions within this sector combine private structures with public purposes to serve citizens. Due to their flexibility and potential to tap in extensive private support for public purposes they have become a powerful force that perform a number of critical functions, often in partnership with the state and the market. This course therefore explores the scope, structure, financing and the role of civil society globally and seeks evaluate its impact on global politics and policy making processes.

3 credits


3 credits
Description: Often medieval philosophy is presented in its Christian guise alone, giving the impression that the medieval philosophical tradition, influenced by the great thinkers of Greek antiquity, is exclusively a Latin tradition, with no substantive contribution by those who wrote in Arabic and Hebrew. We shall revise this view. Our focus will be a select group of philosophers who lived between the 10th-12th centuries, a roughly three hundred-year period that is a high point in medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy—a time before Greek philosophy was rediscovered in Christian Europe. Philosophers to be studied in some detail are Saadya Gaon, Al-Farabi, Ibn Rushd, and Maimonides, and in addressing topics in the philosophy of language, metaphysics, epistemology, 
cosmology, philosophical psychology, and especially in philosophy of law, ethics, and political 
philosophy.

PHI 2100: (GW) Critical Thinking: The Art of Reasoning
3 credits


3 credits
Description: This course is an introduction to the art of thinking and reasoning well. Thinking and reasoning well are of paramount importance for not only philosophy, science, history, politics, business, medicine, or engineering, but for any human endeavor that seeks to give rational support for its assertions. Throughout the course we will seek to refine the habits, patterns, and activities of thinking so as to become more careful, more critical, and more competent thinkers. We will do this by first cultivating the skills of identifying and evaluating arguments; we will then learn to identify patterns of bad reasoning and how to improve an argument. At various points in the course we will turn our critical thinking skills toward selected contemporary issues for analysis. By the time the course is finished, successful students will be more confident in analyzing the arguments of others, constructing their own arguments, and discoursing civily with others about complex and contentious issues.
                            


PHI 2101: Introduction to Logic
3 credits


3 credits
Description: This course will introduce students to symbolic logic. In logic we study the principles of correct reasoning as revealed through language. In this course, students will study both how and why good reasoning works. Our focus will be on the principles of deductive reasoning (in contrast to inductive reasoning). In symbolic logic we use artificial, formal languages to study deductive inferences. In this course students will be introduced to and come to understand two such formal languages (sentential logic and predicate logic) in order to assess and construct good deductive arguments and test for other logical properties. This course satisfies a core requirement for the major in Philosophy.
                            


PHI 2630: (GW) Critical Thinking: Ethical Issues
3 credits


3 credits
Description: This course is an introduction to thinking critically about a range of ethical issues. As such, we will examine the differences between opinions and positions, debates and arguments, and stereotypes and assumptions. We will learn to identify, analyze, and respond to arguments using ethical standards and logical criteria. Because ethical issues are often heated and emotionally charged, we will spend time focusing on how to listen to one another, building our community around intellectually safe inquiries. In order to engage these questions together, we will develop a basic theoretical framework from which to begin, and then drawing on significant philosophical theories of ethics, we will focus our attention on selected issues, which may include but are not limited to issues such as abortion, euthanasia, informed consent, research ethics, food justice, friendship, sex, cheating, and parenting.

In addition, we will look at epistemological puzzles concerning skepticism, the problem of induction, epistemic relativism, and the epistemic significance of disagreement. The philosophical questions to be discussed include: What is knowledge? Can we know anything worthwhile? Given that we do know things, how do we know them? Under what conditions is a belief rational?

The philosophical questions to be discussed include: What makes it the case that one event causes another event? Is free will compatible with determinism? What are material objects? Given that material objects exist, do such things as properties exist? What makes it the case that a person may exist at two different times?

We will ask whether women and men approach moral problems differently and whether women's traditional concerns, such as child care, can enhance ethical theory. We will also consider how "feminist ethics" has been altered by the perspectives of women in different social locations.  We also address practical ethical issues related to sex and gender, such as reproductive technologies, prostitution, and militarism.

PHI 3670: Relativism and Disagreement
3 credits


3 credits
Description: Disagreement concerning how we should live and what we should believe is widespread and persistent. A prevalent response to such disagreement is some kind of relativism – some claim that both parties to the disagreement are correct. In this course we will look at the case for and against ethical relativism (relativism about what we should do) and epistemic relativism (relativism about what we should believe). We will also look in a more direct way at the epistemic significance of disagreement itself. Can reasonable people come to different conclusions even when they have the same evidence? How should we modify our beliefs (if at all) when we encounter another who disagrees with us? And when (if ever) can beliefs be rationally maintained in the face of disagreement?
                            


PHI 3674: Lies and Self Deception
3 credits


3 credits
Description: Self deception is a common phenomenon. In fact, most people seem to have a friend or family member who they think is self-deceived (e.g., about the faithfulness of his or her lover, about his or her beliefs concerning a particular religion or political party, etc.) This apparent ability to lie to oneself in the face of the evidence seems to be a rather contemptuous vice. However, recent psychological studies seem to suggest that at least some forms of self deception are life-enhancing. Thus, it might seem that self deception can be a virtue. In this course, we examine the nature of self deception, evaluate its ambiguous ethical status, and reflect on how these insights should affect the way that we live.
                            


PHI 3700:  Philosophy of Religion

3 credits


3 credits
Prerequisite:  Admission to the MA in practical philosophy and applied ethics or admission to the grad certif. in applied ethics or permission of the philosophy grad coordinator
This course will examine both the philosophical and practical issues raised by (apparent) fact that values can come into conflict. We will examine potential tensions both within morality (between liberty and equality for instance) and between morality and other evaluative concerns (such as self-interest). Question to be considered include: do moral values necessarily harmonize with one another? Might the idea of all good things co-existing be conceptually incoherent? If one comes to think that moral values are inevitably in tension with one another, what philosophical and practical upshot should this have? How much, if at all, can moral theory help in resolving moral dilemmas? Does liberalism, as some have argued, embody the best form of socio-political response to the plural and conflicting nature of value?

PHM 4100: Social Philosophy
3 credits


3 credits
Description: This course is an advanced introduction to social philosophy. While most of philosophy focuses on ontological, transcendental, or otherwise universal categories, inhering either in being or the subject, social philosophers analyze the extent to which basic conditions and structures of experience are socially constituted or shaped. This involves a rethinking of rationality, agency, and freedom—even truth and meaning—as grounded in social structures or processes. The relation between social reality and normative issues like autonomy, rationality, and truth distinguishes social philosophy from sociology, while grounding normative issues in social processes differentiates social philosophy from other domains in philosophy. The course covers classic roots in Marx, Durkheim, and Weber, as well contemporary philosophers like Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, Jürgen Habermas, Anthony Giddens, and Judith Butler.

REL 3405: Jewish and Islamic Thought
3 credits


3 credits
Description: Often medieval philosophy is presented in its Christian guise alone, giving the impression that the medieval philosophical tradition, influenced by the great thinkers of Greek antiquity, is exclusively a Latin tradition, with no substantive contribution by those who wrote in Arabic and Hebrew. We shall revise this view. Our focus will be a select group of philosophers who lived between the 10th-12th centuries, a roughly three hundred-year period that is a high point in medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy—a time before Greek philosophy was rediscovered in Christian Europe. Philosophers to be studied in some detail are Saadya Gaon, Al-Farabi, Ibn Rushd, and Maimonides, and in addressing topics in the philosophy of language, metaphysics, epistemology, 
cosmology, philosophical psychology, and especially in philosophy of law, ethics, and political 
philosophy.

REL 4404: Comparative Muslim Cultures
3 credits


3 credits
Description: This course concerns popular or local "Islams" throughout the world.

We will also employ a variety of approaches to the study of religion to help the student understand a variety of social and cultural phenomena including religious education, the construction of gender identities, revitalization movements, fundamentalism, and religion and politics. The anthropological approach to Islam is clearly distinct from a theological or philological one. In other words, we will concentrate more on the culture and practice of contemporary Muslims than on Islam's sacred texts. We are particularly interested in the cross-currents that are found in otherwise diverse societies.

SYD 4702: Race, Place and Inequality
3 credits


3 credits
Description: This course will examine place as a dimension of stratification in the United States.

While all U.S. citizens are ostensibly free to choose their place of residence, we find that in actuality access to place is highly segregated both economically and racially, and that these two facets of stratification intertwine. Understanding the processes that lead to place stratification, and the means by which places produce or reproduce different life chances, is central to understanding inequality in the U.S.
