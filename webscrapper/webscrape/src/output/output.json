Fortunately, this apparently rigid mold proves, more often than not, to be plastic. Broken up by periods of chaos and upheaval, traditional China features a flamboyant pageant of characters- megalomaniacal emperors, devious palace women, sycophantic poets, wandering scholars, calculating merchants, scheming ministers, daoist mystics, and rebel peasants claiming appointments from heaven-who collectively flaunted, challenged, and reshaped its structure.",

By 1911, gutted by savage civil wars, foreign imperial powers, and corruption, the last of the Chinese dynasties collapsed. The pillars that had for more than two millennia upheld the edifice of traditional China-the imperial monarchy and the Confucian bureaucracy-were no more. This course follows the painstaking transition from tradition to modernity in China, as the Chinese culture transformed gradually into a Chinese nation. Themes include: imperialism, westernization, nationalism, tensions between traditional and modern ideas, student activism and political change, and democracy and communism.",

This course will integrate the student's perspective of the human impact on the river, the legal framework and issues of water quality management and the biotic perspective of a healthy ecosystem. Reading material will include online state river reports. A significant research paper will be required of students which examines one aspect of a major river system whether it be human induced changes, physical or biotic processes, the impact of some physiographic feature, or an aspect ecosystem.",

This upsurge was due to an overall dissatisfaction with the operations of both the market and the state. A broad range of institutions that occupy the social space between the market and the state tackle most of our social, political and economic concerns these days. Known as \u201ccivil society\u201d, \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d or the \u201cthird sector\u201d, institutions within this sector combine private structures with public purposes to serve citizens. Due to their flexibility and potential to tap in extensive private support for public purposes they have become a powerful force that perform a number of critical functions, often in partnership with the state and the market. This course therefore explores the scope, structure, financing and the role of civil society globally and seeks evaluate its impact on global politics and policy making processes.",

We will do this by first cultivating the skills of identifying and evaluating arguments; we will then learn to identify patterns of bad reasoning and how to improve an argument. At various points in the course we will turn our critical thinking skills toward selected contemporary issues for analysis.

However, recent psychological studies seem to suggest that at least some forms of self deception are life-enhancing. Thus, it might seem that self deception can be a virtue.

In order to address these and related questions, students will read plays, analyze scripts, and attend and write about local productions. They may also complete a group project in a live theater.

Using a comparative approach, we will explore the basic questions of how and why animals behave in certain ways to survive, obtain resources and reproduce. Case studies, from both field and laboratory research, will be integrated throughout this course and examples will be drawn from a variety of animal groups to illustrate major concepts. Through this course learners will develop the conceptual framework to understand and appreciate the diversity and complexity of animal behavior.",
