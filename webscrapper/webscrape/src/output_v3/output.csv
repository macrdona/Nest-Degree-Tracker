Thinking and reasoning well are of paramount importance for not only philosophy, science, history, politics, business, medicine, or engineering, but for any human endeavor that seeks to give rational support for its assertions. Throughout the course we will seek to refine the habits, patterns, and activities of thinking so as to become more careful, more critical, and more competent thinkers.

As such, we will examine the differences between opinions and positions, debates and arguments, and stereotypes and assumptions. We will learn to identify, analyze, and respond to arguments using ethical standards and logical criteria. Because ethical issues are often heated and emotionally charged, we will spend time focusing on how to listen to one another, building our community around intellectually safe inquiries. In order to engage these questions together, we will develop a basic theoretical framework from which to begin, and then drawing on significant philosophical theories of ethics, we will focus our attention on selected issues, which may include but are not limited to issues such as abortion, euthanasia, informed consent, research ethics, food justice, friendship, sex, cheating, and parenting.",N/A,N/A,N/A
2789,PHI 2885, Philosophy through Fiction,3,N/A,N/A," This course explores the ways in which philosophy and literature inform one another.

In addition, we will look at epistemological puzzles concerning skepticism, the problem of induction, epistemic relativism, and the epistemic significance of disagreement. The philosophical questions to be discussed include: What is knowledge? Can we know anything worthwhile? Given that we do know things, how do we know them? Under what conditions is a belief rational?

In the course we will carefully consider accounts of causation, the relation of freedom and determinism, laws of nature, personal identity, mental states, time, material objects, and properties. The philosophical questions to be discussed include: What makes it the case that one event causes another event? Is free will compatible with determinism? What are material objects? Given that material objects exist, do such things as properties exist? What makes it the case that a person may exist at two different times?",N/A,N/A,N/A

2802,PHI 3670, Relativism and Disagreement,3,N/A,N/A, Disagreement concerning how we should live and what we should believe is widespread and persistent. A prevalent response to such disagreement is some kind of relativism – some claim that both parties to the disagreement are correct. In this course we will look at the case for and against ethical relativism (relativism about what we should do) and epistemic relativism (relativism about what we should believe). We will also look in a more direct way at the epistemic significance of disagreement itself. Can reasonable people come to different conclusions even when they have the same evidence? How should we modify our beliefs (if at all) when we encounter another who disagrees with us? And when (if ever) can beliefs be rationally maintained in the face of disagreement?,N/A,N/A,N/A
2803,PHI 3674, Lies and Self Deception,3,N/A,N/A," Self deception is a common phenomenon. In fact, most people seem to have a friend or family member who they think is self-deceived (e.g., about the faithfulness of his or her lover, about his or her beliefs concerning a particular religion or political party, etc.) This apparent ability to lie to oneself in the face of the evidence seems to be a rather contemptuous vice. However, recent psychological studies seem to suggest that at least some forms of self deception are life-enhancing. Thus, it might seem that self deception can be a virtue. In this course, we examine the nature of self deception, evaluate its ambiguous ethical status, and reflect on how these insights should affect the way that we live.",N/A,N/A,N/A
